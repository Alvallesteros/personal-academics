    "\n",
    "1. Let $n$ be the guessed key length. Try values from $n = 2$ up to $n = 40$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a function called `hamming_dist` that computes the [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two bytestrings of equal length.\n",
    "The Hamming distance is just the number of differing bits.\n",
    "For example, the Hamming distance between `twelve plus one` and `ElEveN pLUs twO` is $30$. **Please make sure your function works correctly first before proceeding.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each $n$, take the first $n$ bytes and the second $n$ bytes, and find the Hamming distance between them. \n",
    "Divide the result by $n$ to normalize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The $n$ with the smallest normalized Hamming distance is *probably* the key. But just to make sure, you could proceed with the smallest 2 or 3 values of $n$, or you could take 4 blocks of $n$ instead of 2 and average their distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now that you probably know $n$, split the ciphertext into blocks of length $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now transpose the blocks: make a block that is the first byte of every block, and a block that is the second byte of every block, and so on. For example, suppose we have the ciphertext split into blocks of length 5:\n",
    "```\n",
    "QWERT YUIOP ASDFG HJKLZ\n",
    "```\n",
    "then transposing these blocks will yield five blocks of length 4:\n",
    "```\n",
    "QYAH WUSJ EIDK ROFL TPGZ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Solve each block as if it was single-character XOR. You have code to do this, so go use that.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. For each block, the single-byte XOR key that has the best score is the repeating-key XOR key byte for that block. All you need to do is to put them together and you have the key!\n",
